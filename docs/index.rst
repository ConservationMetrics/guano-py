guano-py documentation
======================

This is the `Python`_ reference implementation for `GUANO`_, the “Grand
Unified Acoustic Notation Ontology”, a universal metadata format for bat acoustic
recordings. It includes a production-ready Python module with full
support for reading and writing GUANO metadata, as well as several
helpful commandline utilities. This is :doc:`Free Software <license>` which
may be used for *any* purpose.

For more information about GUANO metadata itself, including the format
specification, see the GUANO project homepage: http://guano-md.org
